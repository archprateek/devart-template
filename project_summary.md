# Project Title
Real Reel

## Authors

## Description
Photographs that contain within themselves living elements giving a glimpse of time moving as well as preserved. If you look at Da Vinci's Monalisa, you are mesmerized by her smile. You play in your mind the movement of her lips seconds before and seconds after the moment was captured on canvas by Da Vinci. What if you can actually preserve the still as well as those lively seconds in one single art piece. What if your hairs can flow with wind in your best photograph or if one leaf could move as you saw it in still photograph of a tree ! 

Real Reel will blend image and video into a beautiful cinemagraph.

I am a sketch artist by heart working on a video advertising startup. This project morphs my two passions into one and preserve the best of both.
